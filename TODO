+ In fpl.py, in order to be able to benchmark/test the quality of different prediction strategies for past/finished gameweeks, I should add an option that only considers relevant data up to that point in time!
- Thoroughly test (1)
- Revise the nomenclature from lines (240, 252)
+ Add the total references to selected_teams.txt (example: Total ^fplAdv*xPts: 100.27200)
- while simulating a particular gameweek (refGW) in the future, i should consider data up to the most recent GW, which is nxtGW-1!
